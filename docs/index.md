## Key Features

- **Real-time Fall Detection** - Transformer-based model for accurate fall prediction
- **Motion Prediction** - Anticipate movements to prevent accidents before they occur
- **Cluttered Environment Navigation** - Robust locomotion in realistic home settings
- **ROS Integration** - Full Robot Operating System support for deployment
